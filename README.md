### NOTE
SINCE THE SIZE OF THE CODE IS SO BIG, IT MAY TAKE LONGER THAN EXPECTED TO RUN THE CODE, AND GOD FORBID SOME FEATURES MAY NOT DISPLAY AS INTENDED ON SOME SYSTEMS.
ALSO, FOR BEST EXPERIENCE, TRY TO AVOID USING THE SQL FILES, AND JUST SIGN UP AND SIGN IN WITH YOUR OWN ACCOUNTS  WHEN YOU RUN THE CODE :)
